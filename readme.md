# fuck-husky

## Important Message

I'm sorry, creators and contributors of [husky package](https://npmjs.com/husky), for the name of this package.

The reason I named it like this is not to insult any of you. It's simply because I couldn't come up with any other name.

If it insults you in any way, tell me and I'll change it :)

Peace ✌️

## Usage

Run this command in the root of your project, where your `package.json` file lives.

```bash
npx fuck-husky ./.git-hooks
```

This command will update `prepare` script in your package.json file to change local git config and rename `.husky` dir to new hooks dir.
